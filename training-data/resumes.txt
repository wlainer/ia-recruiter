I'd like to work for a company that pushes the limits of what is currently possible in the web development world. I enjoy learning something new every day that I work and I'm driven by the idea that every task in the real world has an associated collection of code that can more efficiently execute that same task. 
 
No matter the scope of the problem, I want to work on it. If it's converting a mock-up into CSS or writing a Javascript function to transform data, I'm excited to work through the problem just the same.
Building a modern isomorphic application utilizing a Full-Stack toolkit including: 
 
React with React-Router 
Redux with Thunk and React-Redux 
Node with Express 
MongoDb connected with Mongoose 
HTML5 
CSS3 with SASS 
 
This application is a discussion platform that seeks to solve the organizational issue in complex conversations that can have thousands of participants. My job is to engineer an environment that will open the navigation of these conversations, increasing the velocity with which the conversational information is given to the users, making it easier for new participants to join an existing debate. 
 
I am responsible for the following tasks in the design and development process: 
 
Database design 
API design and implementation 
Application design 
Front-end development 
Back-end development 
CSS styling 
Wireframe and Mockup Design 
UX Design 
Test Framework Design 
 
This platform is by design, not meant to be profitable until a second tier service is created. So in building this application I also have had to research numerous technologies in an effort to find a combination that will allow my collective server costs to be as low as possible without sacrificing performance or hindering any experiences while using the application.

Data Science Developer-Rapid Alloys project: Code in R and other open source languages.   
•    We look at structure – property linkages in different 9Cr steels to develop data analytic tools for rapid development of new alloys at NETL in collaboration  
with Case Western University.  
•    Pairwise correlations were done as part of exploratory analysis. Variables of non-zero variance & frequent occurrences were used to predict strength or ductility. Multi-variate and stepwise regression were used to determine rank order of variables in explaining a mechanical property. Different techniques were used to delineate different classes of alloys i.e.  ANOVA, and Tukey HSD tests on mean of samples, principle components, stochastic embedding (t-SNE), hierarchical and medoid, kNN clustering have been used to visualize different classes of alloys in 2 and 3 dimensions.

As a Software Engineer, I worked on both web and Windows desktop applications. 
Key Contributions: 
•   Web application development utilizing Adobe Flex and ActionScript in the browser and Java as the middle-tier. 
•   Windows desktop application development using C# and .NET. 
•   Technical leader on our office's first large-scale .NET Windows application. 
•   Designed and implemented a XML based rules engine that was estimated to save the project 3 
months development and testing time. It was critical that this area of the application could easily

•    Represented DST Systems for two years at Business Information Technology Institute (BITI) where we presented high school students to a hands-on class about application development. 
The class featured an e-commerce web site hosted on an IIS server. The web site was developed 
using HTML, ASP, PHP, MS Access, and MySQL.
During this time, our team was working primarily with web development. 
Key Contributions: 
•   We delivered a tiered system with a browser front-end, web server middle tier, and mainframe 
back-end. The front-end consisted of a mix of HTML and JavaScript. The middle tier consisted of 
Java running on BEA WebLogic servers. Much of the communication between the front-end and web servers was via XML. I created requirements for the COBOL programmers who would 
complete the work on the back-end. 
•   Wrote various ActiveX controls that were used in the early releases of our application and several 
others that are still being used by another development group. 
•   Wrote several reusable .NET Controls that would be used in place of FarPoint Input Pro controls 
that were used in earlier C++/MFC applications. These include drop-in control for entering text, 
integers, decimals, currency, and custom masks. These controls are now standard in all of DST's 
desktop development. 
•   Because many of our clients locked down their browsers to not allow ActiveX control we decided to go with another technology. To replace ActiveX, I wrote various HTML Behaviors. Each of these was developed to mirror the reusable .NET controls in look and behavior. In addition to the 
controls that were written for .NET, I developed a complex grid behavior. These controls are now 
being used in not only our project but also several other development groups. 
•   Wrote a Windows MDI application using C# and .NET to create real-time graphs and reports of the transactions logged by our web server. The logs were queried from a DB2 database. The 
graphs were created using MS Office graphs and the reports we made with Crystal Reports.

The scope of the project is to populate Enterprise Claims System (ECS) Data Mart which has the insurance related information particularly auto and fire related data. In this project there are two main processes for loading data into Mart. They are Initial Data Load and Incremental Data Load/Update process. Initial Data Load Process deals with the legacy data which was moved from CSR to ECS. Incremental Data Load is a day-to-day process deals with the operation data which has been loading into ECS. We use DPROPR Consistent Change Data Capture (CCD) for this process. Each time an Insert/Update/Delete occurs in ECS Operational system, DPROPR writes these changes to DB2 CCD tables on Data Mart Unix server that we use for our processing. Data from these CCD tables will be extracted and will be used in Incremental Data Load Process.

I am a self-taught web developer, I started to learn web development back in 2013. I can build web applications from the ground up as a full-stack LAMP developer. I’m also a graphic designer when needed. Currently I work part-time for a few clients as well as working at Red Lobster in the kitchen. I work on my own projects on my free time.
I was contacted by a core member of Datawrapper through Hacker News. I was very fortunate for this opportunity. So far it has been my best experience in professional web development. 
 
I'm on the lower end with my contribution to the company namely I'm a feature-request developer and bug fixer. So far I've help implement a Slack webhook notification and created an offline-zip download for the charts/maps.
DiskoberPH is a cloud-based web-photo application that serves photos from various locations in the Philippines for the purpose of traveling. 
 
I developed the site from the ground up and ran into some interesting problems namely API limitations and internet speed which resulted in changes to the website. Namely the use of pre-querying results and storing them in a local database and also developing a progressive-loading mechanism for the photos since the photo can serve over 400 images, with sub-images per image.  
 
This site is still in development at this time.
This was a very expansive client for me which is great. I got to do a lot of different things and still am. I'm currently helping them get more exposure and business. 
 
In the past I initially was contacted to implement Google analytics and fix some of their site's templates. They use a classifieds platform called iLister. 
 
I later did work on a location-based search using Google's Geocoding API's and two others related to distance searching. I built a few scrapers and worked on some database schema related work. 
 
This is a pretty great opportunity and I am still working on new projects for CaravanPoint.

Calendar built with PHP and Javascript 
Using dates from server using PHP, I built a basic calendar with note-adding ability per date using HTML, CSS, 
and Javascript/jQuery. 
View demo at https://www.cunninghamwebdd.com/projects/web-application/calendar/ 
Client IP and URL tracking with PHP 
I wanted to track visitors to my various websites so I created a PHP script which I include at the head of any 
page that I want to track. The script grabs the client's last IP and URL requested then inserts that into MYSQL 
along with a date. If that client has visited before an increment happens rather than a new insert.

Draggable widget with automatic coordinate upload 
I wanted the ability to drag panels/widgets into a position and assign values to them. Although this is just one 
widget, I achieved what I wanted which is a widget made draggable with jQuery and uses AJAX to upload the 
coordinates of the widget. A widget has properties and these are stored in a MySQL database.

Project 
The objective of Strategic Claims Initiative or SCI is to calculate reinsurance for financial received from FE claims. In addition to reinsurance calculation, system generates advices and proofs for reinsurers. It also reports the loss information to Chartis Corporate Reporting System. 
 
Claims Reinsurance processing is a critical area in CHARTIS business where the ultimate corporate business is decided. This system is capable of obtaining reinsurer information from various underwriting systems (DMS, LEX and UPS) and RDPS (Currently re-engineered as SRI), calculating reinsurer share on loss and billing the reinsurer. It also has the facility of billing reinsures and sending advices and proofs. 
 
This system also takes responsibility of generating "corrections" in case of reinsurer information changes or recalculation due to imbalance. Any corrections due to be applied for reinsures because of coverage or policy information changes is also taken care. Loss incurred is divided across the associated profit unit centers and information sent to corporate. CHARTIS business head would analyze the profitable/loss prone Division/Section/Profit Units (DSP) and decide upon the policies/coverage's whether to be retained/modified/withdrawn. 
 
In order to control/minimize the losses with respect to monthly/weekly CHARTIS projections, claims reported with loss incurred beyond certain limit are with held by batch system and provide control to the claims admin users to release them at appropriate time (or upon approval) through online. 
 
Carried out the following activities: 
 
• Analyzed the requirements and prepared the Design documents. 
• Coded the components as per the CHARTIS standards. 
• Did Code Review and prepared the Checklists for all the processes involved in the enhancement.
